# Boris Bikes

## Makers Academy Week 3 Project 

The goal of this project was to introduce us to Object Oriented Programming by building a system for managing Boris bikes in London.

This test was set by [Evgeny Shadchnev](https://github.com/shadchnev) at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com).

### The system will:
* Keep track of docking stations and bikes
* Allow to rent and return bikes
* Make the bikes unavailable for rent if they break
* Manage a garage to fix the bikes
* Manage a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage

## Technologies used
* Ruby
* TDD with Rspec
